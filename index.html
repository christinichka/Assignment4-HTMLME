      <h2 id="main">Why Russia?</h2>
      <p>As a college freshmen, I decided to take a foreign language - Russian. I remember my Mom asked me, "Do you know Russian uses a completely different alphabet?" Nope, I did not! Fast forward to the Spring of 2002, I was in love with the Russian language. I heard about a program called &nbsp;International Language Program (ILP) where people could volunteer to teach English. I signed up and was assigned to go to St. Petersburg, Russia the following Fall semester. I returned the following Fall for a second semester because I loved it so much!

         <h2 id="home">Where I Lived</h2>
         <p>The first semester I spent in Russia, I was priviledged to live with the Petrov family: Elena, Igor, Toma(Tamara), and Tim(Artyom). When I returned to St. Petersburg not even a year later as a head teacher, I did not live with the Petrov family (it was sad for me) but instead lived in my own apartment that was kind of like the hangout/home base for all of the American volunteer teachers of the group. I lived just down the road from the Petrovs on Prospect Bolshevikov and was able to see them often.</p>

         <p>Some of my favorite foods in Russia were:</p>
         <ol>
            <dt>Pelmini</dt>
            <dd>Kind of like ravioli stuffed with ground beef and eaten with Russian sour cream</dd>
            <dt>Blini</dt>
            <dd>Russian style crepes</dd>
            <dt>Shaverma (aka Shawarma)</dt>
            <dd>rotisere style meat cut in thin pieces and placed inside of a pita like bread with a cream sauce</dd>

         <h2 id="transportation">Transportation</h2>
         <p>Russia gave me my first taste of public transportation. I traveled by bus, mini bus, subway, train, street car and even on occassion in a boat in the canals. I also walked A LOT! The subway stations were really far below the surface and you had to ride a very long escalator down to the platform. I quickly learned to stand to the right so that other patrons could run down the left side to get to the platform quicker. The metros in Russia are known to be decorated and beautiful at the platform.

      <h2 id="mainHeading">History</h2>
      <p>I loved visiting the many palaces and cathedrals within and surrounding St. Petersburg. I learned about the Romanovs, Peter the Great, Catherine the Great and other well known Russians. I was able to tour the Hermitage, ride a riverboat in the canals, and meander the streets.
      </p>
         
      <p id="testP"> I also visited the defense and siege memorial and learned from my Russian teacher about what life was like when she was a child during the Siege of Leningrad (St. Petersburg's former name). St. Petersburg was under siege by the Nazis for 872 days. Many Russians died during the siege. My Russian teacher told me that they were given a very small ration of 250 grams of bread daily.</p>
